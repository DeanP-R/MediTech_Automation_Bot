Realistically we'll probs have 2 motors, 4-6 ultrasonic sensors, 1 line following module, 1 colour module, 1 latch, 1 keypad, 1 rfid module, 1-2 lcd screens, weight sensor 
or another ultrasonic sensor to tell the robot when to go. Can't think of much else atm but ill ask at the meeting and see what they're saying
